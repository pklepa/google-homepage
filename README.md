  > Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
  > Identify the background color, font and other attributes in elements of an existing webpage
  > Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
  > Initial grasp and use of Chrome Developer Tools
  > Center an element horizontally
  > Identify three ways to can include your CSS styles in a page
  > Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
  > Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
